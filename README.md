#  Module 2 : Portfolio Page using Advanced CSS, HTML, and GitHub

## Overview

I have created a landing page for a Portfolio website to be used for potential employers. The page has links to previous work, contact details, and a recent headshot.

The page is designed to be responsive and adaptive to different viewports as well as with clickable links both internal and external.
